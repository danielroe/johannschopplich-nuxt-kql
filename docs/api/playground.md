# Playground

Check out the [playground](https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-kql/tree/main/playground) of this module for an example Nuxt project setup.

It's configured to use token-based authentication, but can be used with basic authentication as well. To quickly test this module, use the following Kirby instance and credentials:

```
KIRBY_BASE_URL=https://kirby-headless-starter.jhnn.dev
KIRBY_API_TOKEN=test
```
