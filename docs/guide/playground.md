# Playground

Check out the [playground](https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-kql/tree/main/playground) of this module for an example Nuxt project setup.

You may also take a deep dive into the [Kirby Nuxt Starter Kit](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-nuxt-starterkit), which is a rewrite of the official Kirby Starter Kit with this module.

It's configured to use **token-based authentication**, but can be used with **basic authentication** as well. To quickly test this module, use the following Kirby instance and credentials:

```
KIRBY_BASE_URL=https://kirby-headless-starter.jhnn.dev
KIRBY_API_TOKEN=test
```
